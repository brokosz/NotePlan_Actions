# NotePlan_Alfred_Actions
Alfred workflow for x-callback interaction with NotePlan 3. Based on [this](https://github.com/glushchenko/fsnotes/wiki/Alfred-Workflow) workflow for FSNotes. This is purposefully barebones; I created it based on a personal need but the built in NotePlan 3 Command Bar and other text clipping options (like Popclip extensions: https://github.com/brokosz/Clip2NotePlan) replaces a lot of the functionality here. 

## Changelog
2.6
+ Added: Daily Note support for new notes and clipboard
- Removed: Subwindow since it really wasn't working. Will re-add when Eduard updates the x-callback. 


2.5
+ Added: Subwindow support for new notes

2.4
+ Added: formatting to titles
+ Added: open note on creation
